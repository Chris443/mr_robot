Small Project to learn Qt and get some practice before implementing my own opengl renderer.  
First time i did exception handling, so this part might be really ugly.  

Currently working on:   
Gui Interaction, Rendering Robots are missing

Todo:   
-Pathfinding, Dijkstra  
-Enemy AI  

Done:   
-Map-Loader   
-self-written TGA-Loader  
-Qt-Gui   
-Model View Presenter & Map Culling (without use of qtGraphicsView)
