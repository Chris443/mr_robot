This is an university Project i didn't attend. (I did another one, basically implementing MinMax Algorithm, but looking back this one might be better for learning purposes). 
I'm doing this beside uni stuff just to learn Qt and get some practice before implementing my own opengl renderer.
First time i did exception handling, so this part might be really ugly.

Currently working on:
Model View Presenter & Map Culling (NO use of QtGraphicsView)

Todo:  
-Gui Interaction (Signal/Slot)
-Pathfinding, Dijkstra
-Enemy AI

Done: 
-Map-Loader
-self-written TGA-Loader
-Qt-Gui
